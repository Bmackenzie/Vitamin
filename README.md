A healthy dose of data structures and algorithms. Below is a list of the currently implemented solutions. Note that these solutions have ben hand rolled and rely very little on utiliy functions. To get a better understanding, there is a write of the content here: http://bmackenzie.github.io/Vitamin

**Sorting Algorithms:**
  - InsertionSort
  - SelectionSort
  - BubbleSort
  - QuickSort
  - Heapsort (in progress)
  - MergeSort (in progress)

**Searching Algorithms:**
  - Binary search
  - Sequential search
  - A* Search (once graphs have been implemented)
  - Depth First Search (once graphs have been implemented)
  - Breadth First Search (once graphs have been implemented)
  - Dijkstra Search (once graphs have been implemented)

**Data Structures:**
  - Array
  - Linked List
  - Hashtable
